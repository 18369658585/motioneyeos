## What is motionEyeOS?

**motionEyeOS** is a Linux distribution that turns a single-board computer into a video surveillance system. The OS is based on [BuildRoot](http://buildroot.uclibc.org/) and uses [motion](https://motion-project.github.io/) as a backend and [motionEye](https://github.com/ccrisan/motioneye/) for the frontend.
